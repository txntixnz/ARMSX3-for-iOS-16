# ARMSX3 iOS 16 handoff — 2026-09-30 UTC

User target: iPhone 13 Pro Max / A15 / iOS 16.0 / Dopamine, existing TrollStore.
User explicitly requests using GitHub to compile and says not to monitor the build;
they will report completion. Keep responses concise.

Source: https://github.com/ARMSX2/ARMSX3
Pinned base: 92b931b9fb5eef7f1317cb482917dfc19aceebd9
Build host: txntixnz/ARMSX3-for-iOS-16, main branch.
An empty armsx3-ios16 branch was created in RPCS3-iOS-Releases before the user
created this dedicated repository; no port files or workflows were pushed there.
Workflow: .github/workflows/build-armsx3-ios16.yml
Port overlay: armsx3-ios16/ios; upstream patch: armsx3-ios16/patches.

This checkpoint is P0: native platform diagnostics and a real UIKit patch to the
upstream Metal layer bridge. It is NOT a working emulator; the core is not linked.
Do not claim PS3 firmware installation, game boot or performance is implemented.
Do not confuse the standalone probe target with a full rpcs3_emu build.

Local verification in Linux:
- Compiled/executed ios/tests/vm_probe_test.cpp using g++ C++20 with warnings as errors.
- Tested shared aliases, bounded allocation failure, preservation of an occupied
  hint address, simultaneous 56 GiB layout with PROT_NONE, and cleanup via mincore.
- Apple-style RW reservations fail on this Linux environment at the 12 GiB region;
  this is recorded as an environment result, not a prediction of iPhone behavior.
- Shell syntax and plist/JSON/workflow checks performed before upload.
- Objective-C++/Mach-O compilation requires the Actions Xcode job; no local iOS SDK.

Core findings:
- android/CMakeLists.txt builds rpcsx-android against rpcs3_emu, adding Input sources.
- rpcs3/CMakeLists.txt only excludes desktop Qt when ANDROID is set.
- 3rdparty/CMakeLists.txt assumes desktop MoltenVK paths on APPLE.
- 3rdparty/hidapi/CMakeLists.txt links IOKit on APPLE.
- rpcs3/Emu/Memory/vm.cpp reserves 8+12+32+4 GiB before game boot.
- Utilities/JITASM.cpp, Utilities/JIT.h, Utilities/JITLLVM.cpp and Thread.cpp
  use Apple JIT write-protection APIs; vm_native.cpp has Apple-specific mapping paths.
- Upstream metal_layer.mm used NSView/AppKit; supplied patch supports UIView on iOS.

Next: user reports workflow result; inspect log and fix actual compiler failures,
or inspect on-device diagnostic JSON if build succeeds. Then wire the actual core
and cross-compiled dependencies. A passing JIT test executes only mov w0,#42;ret
through RW->RX memory; it does not establish full RPCS3 JIT compatibility.
Do not shrink guest reservations blindly to fit a small address window.


## P0.1 update
- User confirmed the third Actions run succeeded, then reported instant launch exit
  on iPhone with no Analytics log.
- Removed dynamic-codesigning from signing entitlements (documented TrollStore
  launch-crash risk), plus irrelevant macOS JIT entitlement keys.
- Added final signed-entitlement validation, build number 2, persistent startup
  checkpoints from main(), uncaught Objective-C exception logging, and log sharing
  before any tests. No pre-main or SIGKILL logging claim.
- Removed unused sysinfo_darwin.mm from probe: it had a global Foundation initializer.
- Cause is a strong signing hypothesis, not proven from a device crash report.
- Next: user checks new workflow result and installs build 2, sends startup log.
